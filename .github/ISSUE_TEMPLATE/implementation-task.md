## Summary

- What outcome are we delivering?
- Where is it documented in `docs/dev/spec/spec-final.md` or related context?

## Motivation & Links

- Reference spec sections, design docs, or wireframes
- Link to relevant OpenAPI paths, schemas, or existing issues/PRs

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Criterion 1 — user-facing behaviour or API contract
- [ ] Criterion 2 — tests/quality gates (unit, integration, accessibility when applicable)
- [ ] Criterion 3 — docs or follow-up tasks

## Edge Cases

List the cases derived from `docs/dev/edge-case-checklist.md` that must be covered by tests before implementation:

1. 
2. 
3. 

## Test Plan

- Unit: 
- Integration/API: 
- Manual/Accessibility (if needed): 

## Dependencies / Notes

- Blocking issues, migrations, environment variables, or coordination call-outs
- Mention which agent track (API, Frontend, CI) is primarily responsible
