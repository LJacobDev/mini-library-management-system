# Goals

We are building a 'library management system' as a part of a technical assessment designed to test not just the quality of the developer's output but their ability to use agentic coding tools to speed up development while maintaining high quality code and product.

The developer is expected to implement the core features of the library management system as well as some bonus features that demonstrate creativity and technical skill.

Refer to /docs/dev/requirements.md for the full list of features and requirements.

Refer to /docs/dev/dev-process.md for the developer's notes on their thinking and process from start to finish on this work.

Building high quality software is a priority but so is speed of development, so aim to balance these two goals optimally.


# Workflow Instructions

This workflow is intended to be done in a multi agent way.  To determine which agent you are, please refer to the file /.agent-info in which you'll receive role-specific instructions on how to contribute to this project.

If any step that you're being prompted to do appears to be complex enough that it would be easier to break into smaller steps, suggest this before continuing

If there is any uncertainty about an important consideration, or about what to do next, ask for clarification before proceeding.

If you're doing something that you're not confident about, tell me that you have a low confidence in your ability to complete the task and ask for help so that I can do it.



# Edge cases and Test Driven Development (TDD) Approach

This project is to be done in a way that prioritizes Test Driven Development (TDD) where all new development starts by thinking of what applicable edge cases are possible for any feature/function/endpoint/handler being built, and then writing tests to cover those edge cases before writing the actual feature code.

Please see /docs/dev/edge-case-first-checklist.md for the full edge-case-first checklist that should be used to guide test generation and feature implementation.
