# Wireframe Notes (Placeholder)

_This document will house annotated wireframes for the Mini Library Management System once visual exploration begins._

## Immediate Next Steps

- Sketch low-fidelity layouts for the following flows:
  1. Landing page + catalog list
  2. Media detail + reservation entry point
  3. Member dashboard (`/account/loans` & `/account/reservations`)
  4. Desk checkout / correction workspace
  5. Shared AI chat panel (mobile + desktop states)
- Capture responsive breakpoints (mobile-first) and note Tailwind utility mappings for each section.
- Ensure accessibility affordances (focus order, aria-live regions, contrast) are annotated alongside the visuals.

## Tooling

- Preferred: Figma (share exported PNG/SVG snapshots in `docs/ux/wireframes/` as they stabilise).
- Alternative: Excalidraw or tldraw for quick collaborative sketches.
