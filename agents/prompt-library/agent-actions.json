Include everything that could relate to UI, UX, security, maintainability, code organization, documentation, or any other factor or consideration that can cause this app to function well, look well, feel intuitive and accessible, etc.  Anything that we have not yet explicitly addressed, I want it to be included in this list so that it is exhaustive"

At reasonable checkpoints, I'd like new files to be made, like spec-2.md and so on, showing the evolution of the full spec as decisions are made.\n\nI want the list of considerations to be able handled such that all ideas that get included for this project can be edited into the full spec and moved up from the bottom section.  Any items that were deferred until a later point, or considered but were decided not to include at all, can be left at the bottom, so that the final iteration which will be called spec-final.md, can use them as a list of things that were considered as enhancements to this project, to show that they were thought about and not overlooked.
