At reasonable checkpoints, I'd like new files to be made, like spec-2.md and so on, showing the evolution of the full spec as decisions are made.\n\nI want the list of considerations to be able handled such that all ideas that get included for this project can be edited into the full spec and moved up from the bottom section.  Any items that were deferred until a later point, or considered but were decided not to include at all, can be left at the bottom, so that the final iteration which will be called spec-final.md, can use them as a list of things that were considered as enhancements to this project, to show that they were thought about and not overlooked.

Spec-final.md's exact statements and objectives need to be broken into three orthogonal responsibilites given to three specialized implementation agents to perform so that the spec if fully achieved but with emphasis on it being quickly achieved because it's a demo even though we want it to be of high quality.  Think of certain things that are helpful shortcuts in demos however, like the idea of a mock contact submission form instead of implementing the actual thing.\n\narrange the steps of their respective responsibilities in an order that optimally facilitates the llm agent's success in building up their responsibility in an iterative way with quick feedback loops and easy troubleshooting and co-ordination with other agents timing and needs whenever relevant.\n\nremember to make the steps as discrete as possible so that each step is simple enough to have a low risk and low difficulty performing it, so re-check the steps and if any are still complex, rework the steps into smaller substeps and repeat again as needed.  Indicate if one step requires that another agent's progress reaches a certain point before it can continue with this one.\n\nYou will be able to see and edit their task working files to give them the go ahead when the pending requirement is ready so that they can begin.  We will work on these agent responsibility files iteratively until they look well co-ordinated and ready to hand off to the implementation agents.  Then these agent responsibility files will be locked as a source of truth and new task files which I'll describe later can be derived from them.  \n\nDo you have any questions or concerns for me before we begin?
