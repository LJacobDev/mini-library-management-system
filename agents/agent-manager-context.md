# Section 1 - Context added by user. LLMs do not edit this section.

## Goal of this context file

This is a markdown file meant for an LLM to be able to refer to in order to both read important notes about context and goals and instructions, but also for the LLM to write updates about the context as it changes.

This is so that both the user and the LLMs involved can read this file in order to understand the goals, state, issues, challenges, assumptions, attempts, results and findings and adjustments to approaches, in ways that will help this project be very successful and a strong portfolio piece that has no anti-patterns present.  


# Section 2 - LLM writing area: All lines below here are allowed to be edited by LLMs as needed to help with undestanding state and making effective and smart progress as the project evolves
