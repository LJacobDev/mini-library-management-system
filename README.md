# Mini Library Management System

Submitted by Lee Jacob (LJacobDev)


This application was meant to be a demonstration of rapidly making a high quality demo application in a very short amount of time by leveraging modern Agentic Coding workflows.

It appeared to be getting off to an excellent start in terms of planning out a seemingly robust plan and specification, but the specification began to balloon in size and scope as an unintended side effect of trying to make sure that the MVP would include several high impact low difficulty features.  However, while the purpsoe of striving for a robust high quality spec was to make implementation extremely simple and straightforward, the spec instead took on too much scope for the goals of the project and halted progress.

In its current state, some of the more impressive files in the repo are mainly docs that look positioned to help build a highly well put together app, but it has deviated from its goal of making a working app in a very short amount of time.

A great amount of value was gained by myself as a developer during this process due to the intensive learning from the continuous exposure to extremely wide ranging and thoughtful aspects of application architecture and development, user experience, deployment options, freely available timesaving tools I can use for future projects and more.
